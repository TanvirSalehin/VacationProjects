# Vacation Projects
These are the things I have been trying to learn in the COVID vacation. I must admit it went quite unsuccessful.

Okkay so about the files -->
1. These files were being worked with VS Code, Sublime Text and PyCharm.
2. There are some weird files like .vscode and .code-workspace files, these were created by VS Code. The .idea __pychace__ files are created by PyCharm. So don't freak out.
3. These are not complete projects, in fact most of them are for learning, which will make no sense whatsoever.
